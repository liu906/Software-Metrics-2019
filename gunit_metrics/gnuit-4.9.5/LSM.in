Description:	GNUIT (GNU Interactive Tools) provides an extensible file
		system browser, an ASCII/hexadecimal file viewer, a process
		viewer/killer and other related utilities and shell scripts.
		GNUIT can be used to increase the speed and efficiency of
		copying and moving files and directories, invoking editors,
		compressing and uncompressing files, creating and expanding
		archives, compiling programs, sending mail and more.  GNUIT
		uses standard ANSI color sequences, if they are available.
		GNUIT was formerly called GIT, but the name has been changed
		to avoid confusion with the VCS.
